# ProCAST Automation Presentation Guide

## Materials Created

1. **presentation-outline.md** - Main presentation structure
2. **technical-architecture.md** - Detailed system design
3. **dashboard-mockup.html** - Visual demo of the interface
4. **roi-calculator.html** - Interactive savings calculator
5. **demo-script.md** - Word-for-word presentation guide

## How to Use These Materials

### Before the Meeting
1. Review their current ProCAST workflow if possible
2. Customize the ROI calculator with their actual numbers
3. Test the dashboard mockup on presentation laptop
4. Have backup slides ready (PDF export of the mockup)

### During the Presentation

#### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
Start with impact: "What if you could run 100 casting simulations overnight while your team sleeps, each one learning from the last?"

#### Structure
1. **Problem** (5 min) - Their current pain points
2. **Solution** (5 min) - Clawdbot capabilities 
3. **Demo** (15 min) - Live or mockup walkthrough
4. **ROI** (5 min) - Use the calculator live
5. **Q&A** (10 min) - Technical details
6. **Next Steps** (5 min) - Pilot proposal

### Key Messages to Emphasize

#### For Technical Audience
- "This augments ProCAST, doesn't replace it"
- "Your IP stays on-premise"
- "API-driven, works with existing infrastructure"
- "Learns from your historical data"

#### For Management
- "80% reduction in simulation setup time"
- "10x more design iterations"
- "3-6 month typical payback"
- "Competitive advantage through AI"

### Demo Flow Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Show basic automation first
2. **Build Complexity**: Add AI optimization
3. **Show Results**: Use the dashboard mockup
4. **Make it Real**: Open the ROI calculator

### Common Objections & Responses

**"We have specialized materials"**
→ "Clawdbot learns from your material database and can even suggest property optimizations based on results"

**"Our designs are confidential"**
→ "Everything runs on-premise. We can even air-gap the system if needed. Your data never leaves your network"

**"ProCAST is complex"**
→ "That's exactly why automation helps. Clawdbot handles the complexity while your engineers focus on innovation"

**"What about our existing workflow?"**
→ "We integrate gradually. Start with one product line, prove value, then expand"

### Technical Questions to Expect

1. How does it handle mesh convergence studies?
2. Can it work with our custom material properties?
3. What about multi-physics simulations?
4. How does it handle license constraints?
5. Can it integrate with our PLM system?

### Closing Techniques

#### Soft Close
"Based on what you've seen, what would need to be true for this to work in your environment?"

#### Direct Close
"I can have your pilot system running in 2 weeks. Should we start with the turbocharger line or do you have another product in mind?"

#### Partnership Close
"This isn't just software - it's a partnership. We succeed when you succeed. Let's define what success looks like together."

## Pilot Proposal Template

```markdown
# [Company Name] ProCAST Automation Pilot

## Objectives
- Reduce turbocharger housing porosity by 40%
- Increase simulation throughput by 10x
- Establish ROI metrics for full deployment

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: System integration and setup
- Week 3-4: Baseline establishment
- Week 5-8: Optimization campaign
- Week 9-12: Results analysis and scale planning

## Success Metrics
- Simulation throughput (target: 100+ per week)
- Defect reduction (target: 40%)
- Engineering time savings (target: 80%)
- Knowledge capture (target: 100% documentation)

## Investment
- Pilot fee: $15,000 (credited toward annual license)
- Monthly during pilot: $3,000
- Full deployment: $5,000/month + implementation

## Deliverables
- Optimized turbocharger design
- Full documentation package
- ROI analysis report
- Scaling roadmap
```

## Remember
- Be enthusiastic but not pushy
- Let the technology sell itself
- Focus on their specific pain points
- Always relate back to ROI
- Follow up promptly and professionally

Good luck with the presentation!
